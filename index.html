	<p><img src="headshot/Stern_Headshot.jpeg" alt="Headshot" style="width:25%;height:25%;margin-left:15px;margin-bottom:15px;float:right;">I am an Assistant Professor of Management and Organizations at New York University's Leonard N. Stern School of Business. I specialize in <b>non-market strategy</b>.</p>
	
	<p>One major theme of my research delves into the nexus of <b>corporate political activities</b>, <b>corporate social responsibility</b>, and <b>stakeholder strategy</b>. In an era marked by partisan polarization and democratic backsliding, the strategic imperatives for corporate political activities (e.g., lobbying, campaign contributions) often clash with stakeholders’ desires for such activities to align with their socio-political values. I show that stakeholders’ demand for value congruence may not only undermine strategic returns to corporate campaign contributions, but also transform such contributions into a new avenue of corporate activism.</p>
	
	<p>Another strand of my research explores the intersection between <b>corporate political activities</b> and <b>innovation</b>. Nascent industries and disruptive technologies can generate unforeseen private and social impact that outpaces existing regulatory frameworks. My research illustrates that, in anticipation of policymakers’ rush to fill such “regulatory voids,” firms pivot their campaign contribution strategies to help to elect allied electoral candidates who, once in office, can assume outsized roles in drafting industry-friendly legislative bills and amendments.</p>

	<p>In other research projects, I have examined the political implications of technological innovation in online campaign fundraising platforms, the impact of real estate and cable news markets on campaign donors' and voters' support for the Tea Party movement, and how information from mandatory disclosures may serve as a governance mechanism to mitigate adverse selection in the campaign fundraising marketplace.</p>
	
	<p>My peer-reviewed research has been published in the <b><i>American Political Science Review</i></b> and the <b><i>Journal of Politics</i></b>. My work has received Runner-up for Best Conference Paper Award by the Strategic Management Society, the Jack Walker Award by the Political Organizations and Parties section of the American Political Science Association and the Evan Ringquist Award by the Midwest Political Science Association. I co-founded the <a href="http://michaeljaybarber.com/2023conference">American Political Science Association Pre-conference on Frontiers in Money in Politics Research</a>, and I am a member of the <a href="http://www.nmsrc.net/members">Non-Market Strategy Research Community (NMSRC)</a>.</p>
