I am an <a href="https://csdp.princeton.edu/people/zhao-li">Assistant Professor of Politics and Public Affairs</a> at Princeton University. I study American politics and political economy with a focus on campaign finance in the United States. In particular, my research examines both institutional and behavioral factors that motivate campaign donors to give money to different types of recipients (candidates, interest groups, etc.), as well as the implications of these donations for different aspects of democratic representation in the U.S., including corporate political strategy, political extremism, and electoral accountability.</p>
        
        <p>My research employs a variety of quantitative methods, including quasi-experimental analysis of observational data, record linkage across large administrative datasets, survey experiments, and supervised machine learning.</p>
        
	<p>My research has appeared in the <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/how-internal-constraints-shape-interest-group-activities-evidence-from-accessseeking-pacs/2DF966405543A54CE0BC8BDE18307B56">American Political Science Review</a>. In 2020, I was co-awarded the Jack Walker prize by the American Political Science Association for “an article published in the last two calendar years that makes an outstanding contribution to research and scholarship on political organizations and parties.”</p>
