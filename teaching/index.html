  <br><i>Princeton University (undergraduate)</i>
  <p>This course examines the role of money and interest groupsâ€™ influence in U.S. policymaking. The two main goals of this class are to: 1) introduce students to contemporary research on how money in politics, specifically campaign
finance and lobbying, shapes political representation and policymaking in the United States; and 2) help students make an original contribution to this body of knowledge through their independent junior papers.</p>
