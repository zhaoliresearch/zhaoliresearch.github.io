	<p>Hi! I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Princeton University. Starting in 2020, I will become an <a href="https://csdp.princeton.edu/people/zhao-li">Assistant Professor of Politics and Public Affairs</a> at Princeton University.</p>

        <p>Broadly speaking, I study democratic representation and accountability in the United States with a focus on campaign finance. My dissertation research, part of which was published at the <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/how-internal-constraints-shape-interest-group-activities-evidence-from-accessseeking-pacs/2DF966405543A54CE0BC8BDE18307B56">American Political Science Review</a>, examines what motivates campaign donors to give money to different types of recipients, and the implications of these donations for various aspects of American politics, including</p>
        <ul class="list-group">
            <li>Interest groups: how do the partisan preferences of individual group members constrain interest groups’ ability to buy political favors with PAC contributions?</li>
            <li>Political extremism: how did localized exposure to the subprime mortgage crisis affect Republican campaign donors’ support for the Tea Party movement?</li>
            <li>Electoral accountability: how much can voters learn about candidates’ issue-specific positions based on who donate to these candidates?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>My research employs a variety of quantitative methods, including quasi-experimental analysis of observational data, record linkage across large administrative datasets, survey experiments, and supervised machine learning.</p>
        <p>Please <a href="mailto:zhaoliresearch@gmail.com">email</a> me if you have any questions or desire any additional materials.</p>
