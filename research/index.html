  <p><i>Abstract.</i> Interest groups contribute much less to campaigns than legally allowed. Consequently, prevailing theories infer these contributions must yield minimal returns. I argue constraints on PAC fundraising may also explain why interest groups give little. I illuminate one such constraint: access-seeking PACs rely on voluntary donations from affiliated individuals (e.g., employees), and these PACs alienate donors with partisan preferences when giving to the opposite party. First, difference-in-differences analysis of real giving shows donors withhold donations to access-seeking PACs when PACs contribute to out-partisan politicians. Next, an original survey of corporate PAC donors demonstrates they know how their PACs allocate contributions across parties, and replicates the observational study in an experiment. Donors' partisanship thus limits access-seeking PACs' fundraising and influence. This provides a new perspective on why there is little interest group money in elections, and has broad implications for how partisan preferences and other internal constraints shape interest group strategy.</p>

<p><i>Abstract.</i> Voters reward extremist politicians following economic shocks, with potentially adverse policy implications. However, whether campaign donors in the U.S. respond similarly to economic crises remains an open question. Linking nationwide campaign finance and real estate transactions, I examine how the foreclosure crisis (2007-2010) affected Republican donors’ support for Tea Party candidates, a right-wing faction of the Republican party that opposed government relief for underwater homeowners. Individual-level longitudinal analyses show that Republican donors in distressed neighborhoods reduced contributions to Tea Partiers, but not moderate Republican candidates. In contrast, proximity to foreclosures mobilized grassroots and electoral support for the Tea Party movement. One potential explanation is that Republican donors disproportionately resided in racially homogeneous neighborhoods, and reduced support for Tea Partiers when in-group neighbors suffered from housing distress. Campaign donors, whose lived experiences during economic crises defy those of the broader electorate, may exert distinct influences on post-crisis elections and policymaking.</p>

<p><i>Abstract.</i> The Supreme Court upholds mandatory disclosure of itemized contributions as an important means to help voters place candidates on the political spectrum “more precisely than is often possible solely on the basis of party labels and campaign speeches” (<i>Buckley v. Valeo</i>). To assess the informational value of disclosure for democratic accountability, we apply supervised machine learning to predict candidates' issue-specific positions based on itemized contributions they received prior to entering Congress. Our models accurately distinguish candidates on different issues both within and across parties, generally outperforming predictions based on DW-NOMINATE scores. Moreover, leveraging only non-incumbent fundraising records, our algorithms can impute issue scores for candidates lacking office-holding experiences. We also identify donors that provide the most marginal information on candidates' policy stances. Itemized contributions can facilitate voters' discernment of candidates on issues of interest, and are uniquely valuable for differentiating co-partisan candidates in the absence of legislative records.</p>

<p><i>Abstract.</i> Do firms' presence in local communities lead them to concentrate their political activities in these communities? If so, what are the implications for corporate political strategy and business influence in society? To these ends, we leverage the fracking boom as a natural experiment on the geography of drilling activities across the United States. Using panel analysis and an instrumental variable design, we show that state legislative districts where drilling expanded during the fracking boom received an influx of oil and gas campaign contributions. Moreover, these contributions overwhelmingly benefitted Republican candidates, particularly those in historically Democratic districts, and may have facilitated Republican victories in fracking-intensive districts. Firms' geographic ties to districts not only lead them to channel more money in elections, but also adopt an electoral strategy in campaign giving. Business influence may therefore transform democratic representation across a broad range of constituencies in communities where firms have a local presence.</p>

<p><i>Abstract.</i> An unprecedented number of major U.S. companies announced changes to their campaign contributions following the Capitol insurrection on January 6th, 2021. We analyze the role of corporate stakeholders in these announcements as well as their implications for democratic institutions and business-government relations. Mirroring polarized public responses to the Capitol insurrection, companies with more Democratic-leaning stakeholders (e.g., executives, employees, consumers) publicly refused contributing to Republican legislators who objected to the electoral college results at higher rates. Moreover, these corporate pledges held up in available 2021 campaign finance records, implying potentially sizable fundraising losses for Republican objectors. Given increasing polarization and heightened expectations of the civic responsibility of businesses, the partisanship of corporate stakeholders may prove important in mobilizing businesses to protect democratic institutions (e.g., advocacy of voting-rights legislation). However, such stakeholder pressure may also weaken businesses' bipartisan legislative coalitions, and may compel corporate influence-seeking activities to go dark.</p>

<p><b>Lemons in the Political Marketplace: A Big-Data Approach to Detect ‘Scam PACs’</b> (<a href="mailto:zhaoliresearch@gmail.com">email</a> for an early draft)</p>
<p><i>Abstract.</i> ‘Scam PACs’ are political action committees (PACs) in the United States that raise campaign contributions to enrich their creators (e.g., political consultants) instead of advancing the campaigns or causes they purport to champion. In the 2018 election cycle alone alleged scam PACs collectively raised more than $106 million, which could have fully funded 140 average House campaigns. Scam PACs’ proliferation and lack of regulatory oversight not only undermine PACs’ accountability to donors, but also generate a lemons problem in the political marketplace. To reduce the information asymmetry that donors face in discerning scam PACs, I first examine how scam PACs that have been identified by media reports differ from comparable legitimate PACs on aggregate attributes related to their solicitation strategies, fundraising and expenditure patterns, regulatory compliance, donor characteristics, and PAC donor and personnel networks. Building on these descriptive analyses, I construct a supervised machine learning algorithm that systematically detects scam PACs in U.S. federal elections.</p>
<p><b>Media and Ideological Movements: How Fox News Built the Tea Party</b> (with Greg Martin; <a href="mailto:zhaoliresearch@gmail.com">email</a> for an early draft)</p>
<p><i>Abstract.</i> Does media influence operate primarily on low-information swing voters, or can it also affect the party activists who shape ideological factions? We examine the role of Fox News in the rise of the Tea Party movement within the Republican party since 2009. We use differences in Fox News’ cable channel positions across cable systems to isolate exogenous variation in exposure to the channel (Martin and Yurukoglu, 2017). Earlier in the 2009-10 election cycle, Fox News did not boost Tea Party rally sizes or encourage strategic entry by Tea Party candidates, consistent with content analysis demonstrating a lack of pro-Tea Party slant in Fox News until 2010. However, exposure to Fox News significantly increased campaign fundraising and vote shares in primary elections for Tea Party-backed Republican candidates relative to other Republican candidates. The Tea Party movement benefited from an advantage – rare among insurgent movements – in the backing of a powerful media outlet, which enabled it to rapidly move from the fringe to the center of the Republican party.</p>
