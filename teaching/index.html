<p>At Stanford Graduate School of Business, I have served as the Course Assistant for three years each for <a href="https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&page=0&catalog=&q=GSBGEN+675%3A+Microeconomic+Theory&collapse=">Microeconomic Theory (GSBGEN 675)</a> under Prof. Dana Foarta and Prof. Victoria Vanasco, and <a href="https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&page=0&catalog=&academicYear=&q=polecon+681&collapse=">Economic Analysis of Political Institutions (POLECON 681)</a> under Prof. Ken Shotts. These are PhD-level courses geared towards building a robust foundation in microeconomic theory or positive political theory.</p>
<p>In these capacities, I accumulated a significant amount of teaching experience, particularly via the weekly review sessions that I held for Microeconomic Theory where I independently designed course content to complement studentsâ€™ primary instruction (e.g., writing my own proofs and practice questions for theorems not covered in class). Also, because both courses attract students across various disciplines, including not only the social sciences but also business, engineering, and health policy, I have become adapt at effectively engaging students of diverse technical backgrounds as well as substantive interests.</p>
