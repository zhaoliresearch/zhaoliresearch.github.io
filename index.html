	<p><img src="headshot/Stern_Headshot_2M.jpeg" alt="Headshot" style="width:25%;height:25%;margin-left:15px;margin-bottom:15px;float:right;">I am an Assistant Professor of Management and Organizations at New York University's Leonard N. Stern School of Business. I specialize in <b>non-market strategy</b>. My research examines how firms design and adapt corporate political activity—such as lobbying and campaign contributions—in response to political polarization and technological change.</p>
	
	<p>One major stream of my current research seeks to understand how, as <b>political polarization</b> intensifies, corporate political spending that advances firms' regulatory objectives may increasingly conflict with public and stakeholder concerns about its broader societal consequences. Integrating insights from <b>stakeholder strategy</b> and <b>corporate governance</b>, my work has shed light on how internal stakeholders—such as employees—and ownership structures—such as common ownership—shape when and how firms reallocate political spending in response to these tensions. 
		
	<p>Another stream of my current work is at the intersection between <b>corporate political activity</b> and <b>technological innovation</b>. Novel technologies often outpace existing laws, requiring policymakers to develop new legislation to address unanticipated externalities. I study how firms adapt their political activity during these windows of opportunities to proactively shape emerging policy frameworks that promote, rather than hinder, the adoption of novel technologies.

	<p>In other research projects, I study the political implications of platform innovations in online campaign fundraising, how information and mandatory disclosures mitigate adverse selection in the campaign fundraising marketplace, and how structural changes in real estate and cable news markets shape social movements and party factions.</p>
	
	<p>My peer-reviewed research has been published or is forthcoming in the <b><i>American Political Science Review</i></b>, the <b><i>Journal of Politics</i></b>, and the <b><i>Journal of Political Institutions and Political Economy</i></b>. My work has received Runner-up for Best Conference Paper Award by the Strategic Management Society, the Jack Walker Award by the Political Organizations and Parties section of the American Political Science Association, and the Evan Ringquist Award by the Midwest Political Science Association. I am a faculty affiliate of the <a href="http://www.nmsrc.net/">Non-Market Strategy Research Community (NMSRC)</a>, and I currently serve on the editorial boards of <b><i>Strategic Management Journal</i></b>, <b><i>Organization Science</i></b>, and the <b><i>Journal of Political Institutions and Political Economy</i></b>. </p>
