I study American politics and political economy with a focus on campaign finance in the United States. In particular, my research examines both institutional and behavioral factors that motivate campaign donors to give money to different types of recipients (candidates, interest groups, etc.), as well as the implications of these donations for different aspects of democratic representation in the U.S., including corporate political strategy, political extremism, and electoral accountability.</p>
        
        <p>My research has appeared in the <i>American Political Science Review</i>. I was co-awarded the Jack Walker prize by the American Political Science Association in 2020.</p>
